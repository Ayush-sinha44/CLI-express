# CLI-express 🚆

CLI-express is a Java-based command-line train ticket booking system that uses local JSON storage to manage data.
This project was created as a learning exercise to understand Java application structure, file handling, and basic system design.

## Features

- Command-line based user interaction
- Train search and ticket booking
- Passenger details handling
- Local JSON-based data storage
- Modular Java code structure
- No external database dependency

## Tech Stack

- Java
- Gradle
- JSON
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
